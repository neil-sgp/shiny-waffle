# shiny-waffle
A testbed for integrating Moonsharp into a C# project.

This is a minimal feature replication of the project so that juts the c# interface with Moonsharp can be tested.

Documentation for [Moonsharp](http://www.moonsharp.org/).
## Numbered Text Box
The text box was based on code from [c-sharpcorner](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/creating-line-numbers-for-richtextbox-in-c-sharp).
The code in use was created as a custom component to enable re-use in other projects.
